# Phylogenetic-Analysis-of-Hemoglobin-Sequences-Across-Species
This project constructs a phylogenetic tree using hemoglobin protein sequences from multiple species (human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, chicken, zebrafish, yeast, fly, worm, and E. coli). The workflow includes sequence retrieval, multiple sequence alignment, tree building, and interactive visualization in ITOL.
